## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from your team’s GitHub Releases page.

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for MALAddress.

1. Open a terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and run:
   `java -jar maladdress.jar`<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app may contain sample data.<br>

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will show available commands, while **`help add`** will show the format for the `add` command.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.
   * `add n/Ah Seng Veggies p/91234567 t/supplier t/vegetables r/leadtime:2d hours:0700-1700` : Adds a supplier contact.
   * `find vegetables` : Finds contacts matching the keyword.
   * `tag 1 t/customer t/regular r/no chilli` : Tags the 1st contact and adds a note.
   * `open` : Lists suppliers who are currently open (based on stored operating hours).
   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Saving the data

MALAddress data is saved automatically to the hard disk after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Data is saved automatically as a JSON file at `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`.
Advanced users may edit the data file directly, but invalid edits may cause MALAddress to discard data and start with an empty file on the next run.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**  
If your changes make the data file format invalid, MALAddress may discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Back up the file before editing it.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the data file from your previous MALAddress home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, the GUI may open off-screen after changing display configurations. Remedy: delete the `preferences.json` file before running the app again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** (if implemented as a window) and run `help` again, the help window may remain minimized. Remedy: restore it manually.
